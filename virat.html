In 1998, right after the West Delhi Cricket Academy was instituted, Virat Kohli's father took the nine-year-old to the academy to enrol him. It was after their neighbour’s insistence though as they believed that the talent that young Virat had, should not be wasted in gully cricket and he should immediately join a professional club instead.
